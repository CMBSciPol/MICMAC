Welcome to the tutorials for MICMAC. Currently three tutorials are available:
- :ref:`tutorial_Harmonic_MH` for the sampling of the harmonic likelihood
- :ref:`tutorial_pixel_MICMAC` for the sampling of the pixel likelihood without multipatch distribution
- :ref:`tutorial_pixel_MICMAC_spv` for the sampling of the pixel likelihood with multipatch distribution
